# js_antlr4_book
I'm working through some of the [*The Definitive ANTLR4 Reference*](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference/) book examples using the [JavaScript ANTLR4 runtime](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/javascript-target.md) instead of the Java runtime. Note that the original example source code (all of the non .js files) was obtained from the [ANTLR4 book website](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference/) and is covered by its own copyright.
